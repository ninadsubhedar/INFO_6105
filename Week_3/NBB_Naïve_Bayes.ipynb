For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute, $x$. We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of $x$ in each class. Let $\\mu_c$ be the mean of the values in $x$ associated with class c, and let $\\sigma^2_c$ be the variance of the values in $x$ associated with class c. Suppose we have collected some observation value $v$. Then, the probability distribution of $v$ given a class $c$, $p(x=v \\mid c)$, can be computed by plugging $v$ into the equation for a Normal distribution parameterized by $\\mu_c$ and $\\sigma^2_c$.

    "In probability theory, the multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution. For example, it models the probability of counts for rolling a k-sided dice n times. For n independent trials each of which leads to a success for exactly one of $k$ categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers of successes for the various categories.\n",

A feature vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is then a histogram, with $x_i$ counting the number of times event $i$ was observed in a particular instance. This is the event model typically used for document classification, with events representing the occurrence of a word in a single document (see bag of words assumption). The likelihood of observing a histogram $x$ is given by\n",

This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, called pseudocount, in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is called Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one, and Lidstone smoothing in the general case.\n",

    "Rennie et al. discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems, including the use of tf–idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization, to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machines.\n",

It can be used to represent a coin toss where 1 and 0 would represent \"head\" and \"tail\" (or vice versa), respectively. In particular, unfair coins would have $p \\neq 0.5$. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent boolean data type describing inputs. Like the multinomial model, this model is popular for document classification tasks, where binary term occurrence features are used rather than term frequencies. If $x_i$ is a boolean expressing the occurrence or absence of the $i$'th term from the vocabulary, then the likelihood of a document given a class $C_k$ is given by\n",
